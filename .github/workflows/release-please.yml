# MODUS — Automated Releases with release-please
#
# On every push to main, release-please opens (or updates) a Release PR
# that bumps the version in package.json and generates a CHANGELOG.md.
#
# When you merge the Release PR:
#   1. A GitHub Release is created with the changelog
#   2. A git tag (e.g., v1.2.0) is pushed
#   3. Docker images are built and published via workflow_call
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
